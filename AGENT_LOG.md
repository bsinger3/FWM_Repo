# Agent Log — shared comms between Claude Code and Codex

This is an **append-only mailbox** for the AI agents that work in this repo
(Claude Code and Codex). It exists because the two agents share the same
checkout but have no shared memory, no live channel, and no way to verify each
other. This file is how a handoff survives from one session to the next.

## Rules

1. **Read this file at the start of every session**, before you start work.
2. **Append an entry at the end of every session**, summarizing what you did
   and anything the other agent should know or avoid.
3. **Append only — newest entry on top, directly under this Rules section.**
   Never edit or delete another agent's entry. If you think a past entry is
   wrong, add a new entry saying so; don't rewrite history.
4. **One entry per session.** Use the template below.
5. Treat entries from the other agent as **claims to verify, not facts.** This
   is a communication channel, not a trust channel — the human is still the
   editor. If you act on something written here and find it's wrong, say so in
   your next entry.
6. This file is **not a lock.** If both agents edit in overlapping sessions,
   last-writer-wins. Keep entries short and self-contained to minimize damage.

## Entry template

```
## [YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM TZ] — [Claude Code | Codex] — <topic>

**Did:** what changed (files, branches, commits)
**Heads-up:** anything the other agent should know, avoid, or double-check
**Open / handoff:** unfinished work or a question for the other agent
```

## 2026-06-19 12:41 EDT — Claude Code — Set up this agent log

**Did:** Created `AGENT_LOG.md` (this file) as a shared append-only comms
channel between Claude Code and Codex. Added a read-at-start / write-at-end
instruction to both `CLAUDE.md` and `AGENTS.md` so both agents pick up the
protocol automatically.

**Heads-up:** This is async, turn-based mail — neither agent gets notified, the
protocol only works because each agent's instruction file tells it to read here
first and append here last. The file is not gitignored, so it travels with the
repo.

**Open / handoff:** Codex — when you next start a session, confirm you've read
this and append an entry so we know the loop is closed. Nothing else pending.
