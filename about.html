    <p>
      Friends With Measurements helps you find clothing that actually fits by
      showing you real product photos from people with body measurements similar
      to yours. Instead of guessing whether a dress or pair of jeans will look
      good on you, you can see how it looks on someone with your exact height,
      weight, bust, and hip measurements.
    </p>

    <h2>How it works</h2>
    <p>
      We collect product photos and sizing information from public retailer
      websites where shoppers share their measurements alongside photos of
      themselves wearing the clothing. You can search by entering your height
      (in feet and inches), weight (in pounds), bust size (in inches), and hip
      size (in inches). Our system then finds photos from people with similar
      measurements to yours.
    </p>

    <h2>What "similar measurements" means</h2>
    <p>
      When you search, we match your measurements against our database to find
      the closest matches. We prioritize finding people with similar overall
      proportions rather than requiring exact matches on every dimension. This
      means you'll see results from people who are built like you, even if one
      or two measurements differ slightly.
    </p>

    <h2>Who this is for</h2>
    <p>
      Friends With Measurements is designed for anyone who struggles with online
      shopping and wants to see how clothing looks on real bodies before buying.
      Whether you're petite, plus-size, tall, or have proportions that don't
      match standard sizing charts, our tool helps you find visual references
      from people with your body type.
    </p>

    <h2>Data sources</h2>
    <p>
      All images and measurements come from publicly available product review
      pages on major retailer websites. We aggregate this information to make it
      searchable in one place. When you click through to a product, you'll be
      directed to the original retailer page where you can purchase the item.
    </p>

    <h2>Privacy and accuracy</h2>
    <p>
      We only display information that shoppers have already chosen to share
      publicly on retailer websites. We do not collect or store any personal
      information from our users. Measurements are self-reported by the original
      reviewers, so accuracy may vary.
